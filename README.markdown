# Recipes with Angular.js

A community project dedicated to collecting resources for the [Angular.js](http://angularjs.org) framework. You find here easy to follow cookbook style recipes for issues you are likely to face when working with Angular.js.

[Angular.js](http://angularjs.org) is the superheroic Javascript MVW framework developed by Google.

The original content is based on my ebook [Recipes with Angular.js](https://leanpub.com/recipes-with-angular-js). If you like this project then buy the book to support me!

## How to contribute

You can create an [issue](https://github.com/fdietz/recipes-with-angular-js/issues) on Github in case you find errors in the existing recipes or have ideas for new ones.

New recipes are contributed by forking the [repository](https://github.com/fdietz/recipes-with-angular-js) and sending a pull request.
